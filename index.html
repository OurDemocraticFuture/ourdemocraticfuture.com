        <h3 style="font-style: italic">Establishment politics has made a mess and we need to clean it up. Let’s make the party stronger by deciding its future together. Sign here to join the revolution.</h3>
        <p>The Democratic Party gambled with our future and got us into a terrible mess by playing establishment politics. It’s time for a new system, built by new leadership -- that WE choose.</p>
        <p>Who are WE? We are the majority of this country: young, diverse, tolerant people who want to reclaim and restore our democracy.</p>
        <p>We commit to channeling our anger and frustration into building a real, credible opposition to Trump’s Republican Party. We need to build a new Democratic Party capable of bringing about a future we can all believe in.</p>
        <p>As a first step, we demand to be included in the process for choosing the leaders who will shape the future of the Democratic Party. We want the Democratic Party leadership to commit to:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Give people across the country an opportunity to help shape the future of the Democratic Party;</li>
          <li>Guarantee that any interested individual regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, current political office or residence has a chance to run for the position;</li>
          <li>Ensure a robust conversation among candidates about their vision for the future of the Democratic Party; and</li>
          <li>Encourage a diverse set of candidates to step forward as the next leaders of the Democratic Party, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Democratic Party has the potential to transform the country as an engaged, energized force if it lives up to its name.      </p>
