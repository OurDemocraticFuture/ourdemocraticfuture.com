        <p>The Democratic Party gambled with our future and put us in danger by playing establishment politics. The system is broken and needs to change - and we're starting with the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Who are WE? We are the majority of this country: young, diverse, tolerant people who want to reclaim and restore our democracy.</p>
        <p>We are the angry and frustrated who demand more than a seat at the table.</p> 
        
        <p> We are mobilizing to build a real credible opposition to Trump's Republican Party. Our first demand is to be included in the process for choosing the leaders who will shape the future of the Democratic Party. We want the Democratic Party leadership to commit to:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Give people across the country an opportunity to help shape the future of the Democratic Party;</li>
          <li>Guarantee that any interested individual regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, current political office or residence has a chance to run for the position;</li>
          <li>Ensure a robust conversation among candidates about their vision for the future of the Democratic Party; and</li>
          <li>Encourage a diverse set of candidates to step forward as the next leaders of the Democratic Party, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Democratic Party has the potential to transform the country as an engaged, energized force if it lives up to its name.      </p>
