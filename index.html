        <p><em><strong>Establishment politics has made a mess and we need to clean it up. Let’s make the party stronger by deciding its future together. Sign here to join the revolution.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Establishment politics gambled with our future and got us into a terrible mess. Now, the Democratic establishment is making the same mistake by deciding new leadership without our input.</p>
        <p>We are the young, the diverse, the majority. We’re angry, frustrated and scared about the future. We’re taking charge.</p>
        <p>We need to build real, credible opposition to Trump’s Republican Party. We need to build a Democratic Party capable of bringing about a future we can all believe in.</p>
        <p>As a first step, we demand a fully transparent process for choosing the next leaders of the Democratic Party. We want to:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Give people across the country an opportunity to help shape the future of the Democratic Party;</li>
          <li>Guarantee that any interested individual regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, current political office or residence has a chance to run for the position;</li>
          <li>Ensure a robust conversation among candidates about their vision for the future of the Democratic Party; and</li>
          <li>Encourage a diverse set of candidates to step forward as the next leaders of the Democratic Party, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Democratic Party has the potential to transform the country as an engaged, energized force if it lives up to its name.      </p>
